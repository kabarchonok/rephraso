# Rephraso

> ðŸš§ This project is currently under active development.

**Rephraso** is (not yet) a Progressive Web App that helps language learners speak more naturally and expressively.
It offers elegant and varied phrases organized by intent categories â€” such as asking a question, making a suggestion, or stating an opinion.

Each time you select a category, you'll receive a random phrase from that specific collection to enrich your speech and build fluency.
